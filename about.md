Hi! I'm Rachit

I'm a Cyber Security Enthusiast and a Computer Science Student. I love to solve CTF challenges and learn new things.

I go by the pseudonym `armoredvortex`.

I'm a complete beginner and I'm learning new things everyday. This blog is an attempt to document my journey.

If you find any issues with my writeups or have any suggestions, feel free to open an issue on this [repository](https://github.com/armoredvortex/ctf-writeups).
