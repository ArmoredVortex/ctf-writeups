# Star Wars

## Challenge Description

We have an image file and the prompt says "Hint! This challenge is specially made for blind persons :P"

## Strings

I ran `strings` on the image file and at the end there was some binary data.
`100110101010101010111010100110101010101110101010011110`
However, it didn't yeild anything useful.

## Braille ASCII

Since the hint talked about blind persons, I thought it might be related to braille.
I found a braille ASCII table on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_ASCII).
Upon decoding it, I got:

```
doordonot
```

## Steghide

When I ran `steghide` on the image file, it asked for a passphrase.
I tried `doordonot` and it worked!

```
$ steghide extract -sf star-wars.png
Enter passphrase for starwars.png:
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".

$ cat flag.txt | base64 -d
```
