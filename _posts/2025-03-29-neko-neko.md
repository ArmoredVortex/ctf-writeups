# Neko Neko

## Challenge Description

We're only given a binary file and the prompt is also empty.

## Solution

I checked the file type and it was an ELF file.

Then I tried executing it but it gave me a segmentation fault.
That means it mightv'e been corrupted.

I ran `strings` but got nothing, however using `cat` gave me the flag directly.

`SAIC{sorry_if_you_reversed_it}`
