# noobsb

## Challenge Description

We're provided with a pcap file that contains USB traffic. The flag is hidden in the pcap file.

(Full Disclosure: I had no idea what a pcap file was and had never opened wire shark before, so this was a learning experience for me. Do excuse me if I make any mistakes.)

## Analyzing the pcap file

I opened the pcap file in Wireshark and upon inspection, I found a packet called `GET_DESCRIPTOR` Response DEVICE

Under DEVICE DESCRIPTOR I found the vendor and product ID.

## Identifying the device

Looking up on the internet for the vendor(0x048d) and product ID(0xc996), I found that it's a keyboard.

## Extracting the data

There were a lot of packets and almost all had similar data.
Only a few bits were different in each packet.

I wasn't really able to navigate well in Wireshark, so I exported the data to a text file and cleaned it up so that I only had the `HID Data` field binary data.
I had researched and found out that the keypresses were trasferred in the `HID Data` field.

This is what it looked like:

```

## Decoding the binary data

I came across this resource that beautifully explains how it all works.
[OSDev](https://wiki.osdev.org/USB_Human_Interface_Devices)

I also found this list of HID scan codes that helped me decrypt the data.
[Github](https://gist.github.com/ekaitz-zarraga/2b25b94b711684ba4e969e5a5723969b)

The packets which have `02` as the second byte indicates that `LSHIFT` is pressed, so they will be Capital letters.

## Solution

```python
f = open('data.txt', 'r')
data = f.readlines()

for line in data:
    line = line.strip()
    if len(line) == 0:
        continue
    i = int(line[6:8], 16)
    if line[8:10] != '00':      # If two keys are pressed at the same time, ignore
        continue
    if i < 0x04 or i > 0x27:    #Ignore if out of printable range
        continue
    if line[2:4] != '02':
        print(chr(i-4+97),end='')
    else:
        print(chr(i-4+65),end='')   #Capital Letters
```

gives output: `IITMBINthisisgoingtobealongdayforyoumyfriend`

There were also curly braces and underscores in the data, which I didnt cover in the script so I figured that out manually.

Final flag: `IITMBIN{this_is_going_to_be_a_long_day_for_you_my_friend}`
