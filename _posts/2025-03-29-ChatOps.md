# LDAP Injection for Beginners

## Challenge Description

We're given a login form that authenticates users via an LDAP directory.
Inspecting the source code, we find that if we're able to get to the flag if we can login as user `club` or `saic`.

## Solution

The challenge is to perform an LDAP injection attack to bypass the authentication.
[Reference](https://www.cobalt.io/blog/introduction-to-ldap-injection-attack)

We can see that the username field is sanitized but the password field is left unsanitized.

```php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $username = $_POST['username'];
    $username = str_replace("*", "", $username);

    $password = $_POST['password'];

```

In the login form, one can just enter

```plaintext
username: club
password: *
```

`saic{ld4p_1s_4w3s0m3_4nd_1_l0v3_1t}`
