# Giffy 5

## Challenge Description

We're given a GIF which has frames containing a third of a QR code.

## Solution

I opened the GIF in an [online tool](https://ezgif.com/split) to split the GIF into frames. And just used my phone to scan the QR codes.

<img src="{{ '/assets/images/chronosctf-2025/giffy-5.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Giffy 5" class="img-fluid" />
There were 5 QR codes, outu of which only 2 had something of value.

```
enc_flag - niop{k1wjg_4z3_C4ggy1ro_n}
```

```
key - vigenere_it_is
```

Then I used [dcode](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) to decode the flag.

`saic{g1ffy_fr4m3s_4r3_W4tch1ng_u}`
